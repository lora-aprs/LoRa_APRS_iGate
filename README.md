## Intention
I forked this version because of my intention to build a specialized tracker for my mobile home. It should collect data from some sensors, weather condition etc. and send it to the APRS-System in two ways: If no wifi is present, it should just send the Packet to 433 MHz. If a known wifi is present, it should try to send the packet via wifi to the APRS-System direct.



# Future plans

* [ ] add position tracking from gps
* [ ] feeding webpage with status-info
* [ ] web-page sensors information
* [ ] just playing around with it...
